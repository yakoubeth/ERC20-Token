# ERC20-Token
 an ERC-20 Token smart contract, and a dapp to interact with your contract (claim, transfer and show connected wallet balance)
 
ERC20-Token is an implementation of a standard ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC20 standard defines a set of rules and interfaces that a token contract must implement to be able to interact with other contracts and wallets that support the standard.

Getting Started
To get started with ERC20-Token, you'll need to have a working Ethereum development environment set up on your local machine. You can use tools like Truffle and Ganache to set up a local blockchain network and deploy and test the contract.

Once you have a working development environment set up, you can clone the ERC20-Token repository and compile and deploy the contract using the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/yakoubeth/ERC20-Token.git
cd ERC20-Token
truffle compile
truffle migrate

This will compile the contract and deploy it to your local blockchain network.

Usage
Once you have deployed the contract, you can interact with it using any Ethereum wallet or contract that supports the ERC20 standard.
